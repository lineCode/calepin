## What Makes Someone Look Older?

### Face Shape

The loss of elasticity thins the jawbone, narrowing the chin and causes the chin to droop.

### Forehead

Forehead lines appear when one tries to hold the brows and eyelids up to counteract these changes.

### Crow's Feet

Crows feet are wrinkles at the corner of the eyes that appear after years of squinting, laughing, and smiling.

### Lower Face

The muscles of the face, called “laugh lines”, are attached to the skin along the nasolabial line.
