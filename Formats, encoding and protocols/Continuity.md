Need BT LE (4.0, Bluetooth low energy, aka iBeacons) on (for proxmity detection?), on same Wi-Fi network (auto adhoc too?) + each device connected on same iCloud account

Handoff, AirDrop, Instant Hotspot, Universal Clipboard

Unlock with iWatch use [Time-of-Flight](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6817861/) (802.11ac Wi-Fi) instead

> Apple's Cloud (iCloud) checks the user has permission to access the file, Bluetooth 4.0 (iBeacon) detects when devices are nearby, and Wi-Fi Direct (AirDrop) sends files high-speed over a secure peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection.

> Handoff passes only enough information between the devices to describe the activity itself, while larger-scale data synchronization is handled through iCloud.
