Caption 		A short factual description of the image used by customers
			to summarise its content. 					128 		Low

Essential keywords 	The most important words and phrases for the image. Although
			you have 50 characters, try to limit yourself to just 35 -
			about 6 to 8 words only. 					50 		Very high

Main keywords 		The next most appropriate words and phrases. These keywords
			are not displayed to clients. 					300 		High

Comprehensive keywords 	Any other words and phrases. Put all the remaining terms
			that apply, but which are not as significant as main or
			essential keywords. These keywords are not displayed to
			clients. 							856 		Medium

Description 		Explanatory or background text relevant to the image. More
			appropriate for historical, reportage and editorial images
			than for conceptual or commercial material. 			2000 		Zero

			country. This information can make or lose a sale. 		100 		Low

			the date the image was created not the date it was scanned
			or submitted. If you feel the date is of particular
			significance, for example “England winning the Football
			World Cup in 1966” then also put it in the Caption and
			Essential keyword fields depending on the date’s relevancy. 	– 		–

Only use spaces to separate keywords. There is no need to use commas as well as you will use up valuable character space.
Alamy do not employ stemming, for example, we do not automatically add plurals. So if you think both the plural and singular of a term is relevant you must add them both. However think carefully before adding both in all cases. You do not want your images of ‘a dog with two boys’ coming up for a search for ‘two dogs’.
Add words with the same meaning. If you add “mother”, also add “mum”.
Consider UK and US variations, so in the example above, add “mom”.
Check your spelling!
You can further enhance the accuracy of your keywording by using additional annotation options.
Describe your images in a methodical way when keywording:

	Literal - e.g. “boy, girl, children, beach, sun, sand, sky, car, shadow”.
	Attributes - e.g. “happy, smiling, walking, blue, young, old”.
	Location - be specific, e.g. “The White House, Washington DC, USA”; or generic, e.g. “office, school, home”.
	Interaction - e.g. “chasing, playing, moving, touching, shouting, flying”.
	Concepts - e.g. “heat, power, happiness, strength, humour, teamwork, tranquility etc”.
	Broad subjects - e.g. “lifestyle, travel, sport and business”.
	Techniques - e.g. “predominant colours or shapes, black and white, grainy, blurred, digital manipulation”.
