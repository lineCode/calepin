### Native timelaps

Limited to:

- delay/interval: 1 to 30 minutes
- frames: 10, 20, 30... to 60

> if the power saving timeout is short enough you'll notice the lens will go in and out repetitively instead of just staying on the current position, means the sleep mode will shutdown the lens as well

### Timelaps with miniature effect

In Creative Control Mode (Brush & Palette) with Miniature Effect:

There are three tweaks for this mode, requiring two buttons/dials:

You push the upper right dial and you get two options:

- EV adjustment (exposure compensation).
- Saturation. If you move this all the way to the left you get normal saturation, so the video in this mode will look like regular video.

You push the left button and you get the option for the size of the focus area. By moving the upper-right dail you can change this. If you enlarge the area to the maximum, most of the frame will be in focus and it will look like normal video.

If you enlarge the focus area and de-saturate you will get a 1/10th time-lapse video in full 108060p, 28Mbps that will match the rest of the video.

> given the relatively slow graphic processor in LX7, if you choose Miniature Creative Style and just shoot away with the movie button, you'll have a videos of a fixed (about 3~4fps, sorry I didn't really count it) speed time lapse... after all, yes, you're still bounded by the 29min59sec limit.
