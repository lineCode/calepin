## Security

### Audit â€” Lynis

Scans the system and available software, to detect security issues. Beside security related information it will also scan for general system information, installed packages and configuration mistakes

This software aims in assisting automated auditing, software patch management, vulnerability and malware scanning of Unix based systems. It can be run without prior installation, so inclusion on read only storage is no problem (USB stick, cd/dvd).

Lynis assists auditors in performing Basel II, GLBA, HIPAA, PCI DSS and SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) compliance audits.

Install:

	sudo apt-get install lynis

Exec:

	sudo lynis -c

	sudo grep Warning /var/log/lynis.log

	sudo grep Suggestion /var/log/lynis.log
