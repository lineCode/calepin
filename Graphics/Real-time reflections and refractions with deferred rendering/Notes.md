> Real-time reflections and refractions. This was my final project for the GPU Programming and Architecture class that I took in Spring 2012. The main approach is to use deferred rendering to capture scene information like positions, normals, colors, and other material information and then perform ray-tracing over that data in screen space. This technique works well because it is independent of scene complexity. I have a slightly improved version of the technique in the more recent game engine video.
